"That thing"
=======

One simple project I made for a wedding invitation some time ago. Recently I cleaned up the code in order to learn something new and now it's available to you to fix all of my horrible mistakes made to the JavaScript/CSS world.

You can play with it as well.


Install
-----------------------

Nothing to install, just run `index.html` in the browser. It's that simple.


Demo
-----------------------

You can check the demo [here](https://www.msuflaj.net/projects/that-thing/).

**Note that it may (but really shouldn't) end up in an infinite loop if width has oscillations in respect to the font size. If you do find such a case, please let me know since I'm quite interested if such case even exists.**


Further plans
-----------------------

I may play with it in the future since I quite like it. I may add some printing and other net functionality depending on my spare time. Also better site responsiveness would be cool.
